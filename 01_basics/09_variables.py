#python ek dynamic progrming langusge hai kyoki runtime pe decide hota hai ki iska type kya hoga

# variable naming rule

#1number = 4 wrong
# _name = "chitranjan" can start with letter and underscore
# cannot use special symbol

# convention for variable

user_One_name = "chitranjan" #snake case writing

userOneName = "chittu"  #camel case writing
